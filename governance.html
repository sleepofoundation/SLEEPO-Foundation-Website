      <h3>Financial Accountability & Stewardship</h3>
      
      <h4>Fiscal Year</h4>
      <p>Calendar year (January 1 — December 31)</p>
      
      <h4>Current Funding</h4>
      <p>
        Sleepo Foundation is currently in its startup phase, funded by the founder's personal contributions. We project annual gross receipts of less than $50,000 for our first three years of operation, with all funds dedicated to program development and charitable service delivery.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Use of Funds (Budget Allocation)</h4>
      <p>Our budget prioritizes direct program services:</p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>70% Program Expenses:</strong> Story development, pilot programs with families, educational materials, research and evaluation</li>
        <li><strong>20% Administrative:</strong> Filing fees, insurance, website/technology infrastructure, professional services (legal, accounting)</li>
        <li><strong>10% Fundraising & Development:</strong> Grant writing, donor communications, partnership development (future)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Financial Policies & Controls</h4>
      <p>
        Sleepo Foundation maintains strict financial controls to ensure responsible stewardship:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>No private inurement:</strong> No individual receives private benefit from organizational assets</li>
        <li><strong>Board approval required:</strong> Expenditures over $1,000 require board vote</li>
        <li><strong>Independent review:</strong> Treasurer conducts quarterly financial review</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> We comply with all federal and state reporting requirements</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Financial information available to funders and partners upon request</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Future Financial Reporting</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        Once our 501(c)(3) status is approved and our gross receipts exceed $50,000 annually, we will file Form 990 returns which will be publicly available via GuideStar and the IRS. Organizations with gross receipts under $50,000 file Form 990-N (e-Postcard). All filings demonstrate our commitment to financial transparency and accountability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Equal Access & Non-Discrimination</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Sleepo Foundation does not and will not discriminate</strong> on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        This commitment applies to:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Selection of families and children served by our programs</li>
        <li>Recruitment and selection of volunteers, advisors, and (future) employees</li>

      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Key Organizational Policies</h3>
      
      <h4>Conflict of Interest Policy</h4>
      <p>
        All board members, officers, and key employees must annually disclose any potential conflicts of interest. When a conflict exists, the interested party must recuse themselves from discussion and voting on the matter. This ensures all decisions serve the organization's charitable mission, not private interests.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Whistleblower Policy</h4>
      <p>
        Sleepo Foundation is committed to lawful and ethical behavior. We maintain a whistleblower policy that protects individuals who report suspected violations of law or policy from retaliation.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Document Retention Policy</h4>
      <p>
        We maintain appropriate records including articles of incorporation, bylaws, board minutes, financial records, tax returns, and program documentation in accordance with legal requirements and nonprofit best practices.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Gift Acceptance Policy</h4>
      <p>
        We accept donations that further our charitable mission. We do not accept gifts with restrictions that conflict with our mission, compromise our independence, or create undue administrative burden. All donations are acknowledged in writing for tax purposes (once 501(c)(3) status is approved).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Privacy & Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        During this early phase, we minimize the amount of personal information we collect. When families choose to share information with us as part of a pilot, we use it only for the purposes that have been clearly explained, such as crafting personalized stories or understanding patterns that inform our program design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our commitments:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>We do not sell or share personal data with third parties</li>
        <li>We collect only information necessary for program delivery</li>
        <li>Families provide informed consent before participating in pilots</li>
        <li>Data is stored securely and retained only as long as necessary</li>
        <li>Families can request deletion of their data at any time</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        A more detailed privacy notice will be published before any large-scale public offering is launched. We are committed to evolving our privacy practices as our work grows while maintaining the highest standards of data protection.
