    <h2>Why Sleepo Foundation exists.</h2>
    <p>
      The seed for Sleepo Foundation was planted in an ordinary family home, during ordinary bedtime routines. Like many caregivers, we saw how big feelings often waited until the very end of the day to appear — worries about school, friendship struggles, questions about identity, or simply the feeling of being "too full" from the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also noticed that the simplest moments helped most: a short personalized story, a calm voice, language that gave children permission to feel, and reminders that they were loved exactly as they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Yet we recognized that many families—especially those in rural areas, immigrant communities, or facing financial constraints—lacked access to the specialized mental health resources that could provide this kind of support.</strong> That's why Sleepo Foundation was created as a nonprofit: to ensure that every child, regardless of family circumstances, could access tools for emotional well-being.
    </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Charitable Purpose & Tax-Exempt Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Sleepo Foundation is organized exclusively for <strong>charitable and educational purposes</strong> under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, we provide <strong>free educational resources</strong> that promote the emotional well-being and mental health of children ages 2-12 through evidence-informed storytelling methods. Our work serves the <strong>public benefit</strong> by making emotional literacy tools accessible to families who may lack access to specialized mental health support due to geographic, financial, or cultural barriers.
      </p>
      
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Our charitable activities include:</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li><strong>Educational storytelling resources</strong> for children's emotional development (provided free or at nominal cost under $5)</li>
          <li><strong>Parent education programs</strong> on emotional literacy and family well-being (no-cost to participants)</li>
          <li><strong>Research and evaluation</strong> to advance knowledge in childhood emotional health education</li>
          <li><strong>Community partnerships</strong> to reach underserved families in rural and urban areas</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p class="muted">
        <strong>Public Benefit:</strong> All programs are provided free or at nominal cost to ensure accessibility. No part of our net earnings benefits any private individual or shareholder. Upon dissolution, all assets will be distributed to organizations with similar charitable purposes under Section 501(c)(3).

      <h3>Our approach to this work</h3>
      <div class="section-grid two-col">
        <div class="value-card">
          <h4>Stories as gentle mirrors</h4>
          <p>
            We create stories that reflect back children's strengths, challenges, and cultural contexts in a warm, affirming way — never shaming or fear-based. Each story is personalized to the child's specific emotional needs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h4>Bedtime as a daily anchor</h4>
          <p>
            We see bedtime as a natural anchor point for emotional learning: a few quiet minutes where a child can feel close, heard, and held before sleep — when they're most receptive to processing feelings.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h4>Technology as a quiet helper</h4>
          <p>
            When we use technology, we do so with intention: to ease the workload on caregivers, not to replace them; to simplify access, not to overstimulate. Technology serves the mission, not the reverse.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="value-card">
          <h4>Family-centered design</h4>
          <p>
            We design with entire families in mind: children, parents, grandparents, and others who share caregiving responsibilities across cultures, languages, and time zones.
          </p>

      <h3>Who we serve & how we serve them</h3>
      
      <h4>Primary Beneficiaries</h4>
      <p>Children ages 2-12 and their families, with particular focus on:</p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Families in rural or underserved areas with limited access to mental health professionals</li>
        <li>Immigrant and refugee families seeking culturally responsive emotional support</li>
        <li>Low-income families who cannot afford private therapy or counseling</li>
        <li>Children experiencing anxiety, major transitions, or emotional challenges</li>
        <li>Parents who want to support their children's emotional development but lack specialized training</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Geographic Service Area</h4>
      <p>
        Currently serving families in Washington State, with plans to expand to Oregon and Idaho as funding and capacity allow. Our long-term goal is to serve families nationwide through scalable digital resources.
      </p>
      
      <h4>No-Cost Access</h4>
      <p>
        All educational resources and programs are provided at <strong>no cost or nominal cost (under $5)</strong> to ensure that financial barriers never prevent a family from accessing support. This is fundamental to our charitable mission.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Values that guide our work</h3>
      <p>
        Sleepo Foundation operates according to core values that ensure we remain true to our charitable purpose:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Free or low-cost services for all families, regardless of income</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural responsiveness:</strong> Resources that honor diverse family structures, languages, and traditions</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence-based:</strong> Methods grounded in child development research and practitioner expertise</li>
        <li><strong>Family empowerment:</strong> Tools that build family capacity, not dependence on external services</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy & ethics:</strong> Minimal data collection, transparent practices, no commercial exploitation</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Partnership with families, educators, and mental health professionals</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Why nonprofit status matters</h3>
      <p>
        We chose to organize as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (rather than a business or for-profit social enterprise) because:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>We can prioritize <strong>public benefit over profit</strong>, ensuring services remain free or low-cost</li>
        <li>We're <strong>accountable to our mission</strong>, not shareholders seeking financial returns</li>
        <li>Families can trust that <strong>we're not selling their data</strong> or exploiting their vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>We can accept <strong>tax-deductible donations and grants</strong> that support our charitable work</li>
        <li>We operate with <strong>transparency and public oversight</strong> through Form 990 reporting</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        We do not build products designed to maximize screen time, advertising revenue, or data extraction. Our interest is in sustainable, family-centered practices that help children feel grounded, cared for, and capable.
